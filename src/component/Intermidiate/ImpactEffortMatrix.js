          The Impact Effort Matrix is a powerful tool for prioritizing tasks. It
          helps you quickly see which activities will bring the best return for
          the effort required, allowing you to focus on high-impact tasks while
          avoiding time-wasters. By mapping actions based on effort and impact,
          you can make smarter, data-driven decisions that balance short-term
          wins with long-term strategy.
